## Project Objective:
Developing a Butterfly Image Classification System Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Transfer Learning with Pre-trained Models.

## Description:
The objective of this project is to create an accurate and reliable system for classifying images of butterflies into their respective species. 
The project involves two main phases:

1. CNN Model Development:
* Train a convolutional neural network (CNN) from scratch using a dataset of butterfly images.
* Experiment with various CNN architectures, hyperparameters, and data augmentation techniques to optimize the model's performance.
* Evaluate the model's accuracy to assess its effectiveness in classifying butterfly images.

2. Transfer Learning with Pre-trained Models:
* Utilize transfer learning to enhance the performance of the classification system.
* Fine-tune a pre-trained deep learning model (InceptionV3) on the butterfly image dataset.
* Fine-tuning involves adapting the pre-trained model to the specific characteristics of the butterfly image dataset by adjusting the model's weights.
* Compare the performance of the fine-tuned model with the CNN model developed from scratch.
  
## Expected Outcomes:
* A trained CNN model capable of accurately classifying images of butterflies into different species.
* A fine-tuned pre-trained model with improved classification performance compared to the CNN model.
* Evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure the performance of both models.
* Insights into the effectiveness of transfer learning for butterfly image classification tasks.
